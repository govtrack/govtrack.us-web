				{% elif stat.key == "bills-introduced" %}
					<p>The number of bills each legislator introduced in {{period}}.</p>

				{% elif stat.key == "bills-enacted" %}
					<p>The number of bills each legislator introduced that became law in {{period}}. Keep in mind that it takes a law to repeal a law. Very few bills ever become law.</p>
				
				{% elif stat.key == "bills-enacted-ti" %}
					<p>The number of bills each legislator introduced that became law in {{period}}, including via incorporation into other bills. Keep in mind that it takes a law to repeal a law. Very few bills ever become law.</p>

				{% elif stat.key == "bills-reported" %}
					<p>The number of bills that each legislator introduced in {{period}} that got past committee and to the floor for consideration. Most bills and resolutions languish in committee without any action.</p>

				{% elif stat.key == "bills-with-committee-leaders" %}
					<p>The number of bills that each legislator introduced in {{period}} that had a cosponsor who was a chair or ranking member of a committee that the bill was referred to. Getting support from committee leaders on relevant committees is a crucial step in moving legislation forward.</p>

				{% elif stat.key == "bills-with-cosponsors-both-parties" %}
					<p>In this era of partisanship, it is encouraging to see Members of Congress working across the aisle. This is the percent of bills introduced by each legislator in {{period}} which had both a Democratic cosponsor and a Republican cosponsor.</p>
				
				{% elif stat.key == "bills-with-cosponsors-both-parties-count" %}
					<p>In this era of partisanship, it is encouraging to see Members of Congress working across the aisle. This is the number of bills introduced by each legislator in {{period}} which had both a Democratic cosponsor and a Republican cosponsor.</p>

				{% elif stat.key == "bills-with-cosponsor-other-party" %}
					<p>In this era of partisanship, it is encouraging to see Members of Congress working across the aisle. This is the number of bills introduced by each legislator in {{period}} which had a cosponsor from the other political party than the party the legislator caucused with.</p>

				{% elif stat.key == "bills-with-companion" %}
					<p>The House and Senate often work on the same issue simultaneously by introducing <emph>companion bills</emph> in each chamber. This is the number of bills introduced by each legislator in {{period}} that had a companion bill in the other chamber. Working with a sponsor in the other chamber makes a bill more likely to be passed by both the House and Senate.</p>

				{% elif stat.key == "cosponsors" %}
					<p>The total number of cosponsors joining the bills written by each legislator in {{period}}.</p>

				{% elif stat.key == "cosponsored" %}
					<p>The number of bills cosponsored by each legislator in {{period}}.</p>

				{% elif stat.key == "cosponsored-other-party" %}
					<p>In this era of partisanship, it is encouraging to see Members of Congress working across the aisle. This is the percent of bills cosponsored by each legislator which were introduced by a member of the other party.</p>

				{% elif stat.key == "ideology" %}
					<p>Our unique ideology analysis assigns a score to Members of Congress according to their legislative behavior by whether they sponsor and cosponsor overlapping sets of bills and resolutions with other Members of Congress. The score can be interpreted as a left&mdash;right scale measuring the dominant ideological difference or differences among Members of Congress, although of course it only takes into account a small aspect of reality.</p>

				{% elif stat.key == "leadership" %}
					<p>Our unique leadership analysis looks at who is cosponsoring whose bills. A higher score
					shows a greater ability to get cosponsors on bills.</p>

				{% elif stat.key == "committee-positions" %}
					<p>A score, giving five points for each full committee leadership position and one point for each subcommittee leadership position, for each legislator.</p>

				{% elif stat.key == "transparency-bills" %}
					<p>GovTrack looked at whether legislators supported any of the <a href="https://github.com/govtrack/govtrack.us-web/blob/master/analysis/transparency-bills.txt">government transparency, accountability, and effectiveness bills</a> that we identified in {{period}}. We gave a score to each legislator based on one point for cosponsoring and three points for sponsoring any of these bills.</p>
