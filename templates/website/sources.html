	<h1>Data Sources</h1>
	
	<p>Although we gather some information by hand, GovTrack pulls much of the information you see from a variety of other sources. We also make available the information we collect in a normalized XML format for other projects to reuse. For more information on that, see the <a href="/developers">Developer Documentation</a>.</p>
