     <p>
       This page lists {{entries|length|intcomma}} instances of alleged and actual misconduct by legislators in the United States Congress
       from 1789 to the present.
     </p>
     <p>
       The database below has been collected from public information about congressional investigations, criminal convictions,
       censures by and expulsions from Congress, and more, see the sidebar.
       The list is updated as new information becomes available.
     </p>
     <p>
       An allegation of misconduct listed on this page <strong>does not imply guilt</strong>, unless it is followed by an official determiniation of guilt.
       Conversely, the absence of a determination of guilt <strong>does not imply innocence</strong>
       because congressional investigative bodies are political, not judicial.

        <h2>What&rsquo;s Included On This Page</h2>
        <p>We have included:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>All letters of reproval, censures, and expulsions from Congress from 1789 to the present.</li>
          <li>All investigations by the <a href="https://oce.house.gov/">House Office of Congressional Ethics (OCE)</a> (2008&ndash;), the <a href="https://ethics.house.gov/">House Committee on Ethics (HCE)</a> (1975&ndash;), and the <a href="https://www.ethics.senate.gov/public/">Senate Select Committee on Ethics (SSCE)</a> (1962&ndash;), and all Senate votes on &ldquo;exclusion&rdquo; related to personal misconduct.</li>
          <li>Some other investigations by a body of Congress and monetary settlements that involved alleged personal misconduct that we are aware of, e.g. settlements administered by Congress&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.compliance.gov/">Office of Compliance</a> regarding sexual harassment claims, but most settlements are not known to the public.</li>
          <li>Resignations that we believe to be likely relevant to an allegation of misconduct, because legislators often resign to head-off a Congressional investigation.</li>
          <li>Felony convictions and other cases of misconduct with national significance before and after the legislator&rsquo;s time in Congress.</li>
         </ul>

         <h2>Are They Guilty</h2>
         <p>Investigations, settlements, and resignations <strong>do not imply guilt</strong>. Some investigations are motivated by politics or a personal grudge, settlements are often used when it would be less costly than defending a law suit, and legislators often resign when they are likely to lose re-election (regardless of why). We include investigations even if the legislator is exonerated because the investigation and exoneration are themselves important events that it is a part of our mission to chronicle.</p>
         <p>Conversely, an investigation that ends without a guilty determination <strong>does not imply innocence</strong> --- Congress polices itself in many cases and legislators are reluctant to punish their peers.</p>
         <p>Not all misconduct is treated equally, and the types of misconduct that have consequences have changed drastically over time. You won&rsquo;t see sexual harassment before the 1980s, but you will see overt racism, enforcement of sodomy law, and murder.</p>
