<p>1. GovTrack.us&rsquo;s mission is to help Americans participate in their government.</p>
<ul>
<p>a. We make information about the United States Congress accessible, understandable, and actionable for public use.</p>
<p>b. We do this by putting the information in context, tracking new developments on issues our users care about, and helping our users take action to make a meaningful difference.</p>
<p>c. We actively seek out any information relevant to our mission and new ways to analyze and explain that information.</p>
<p>d. GovTrack.us and the information we publish will always be free to view, use, and share by anyone.</p>
</ul>

<p>2. We are committed to integrity.</p>

<ul>
<p>a. We know that government decisions have grave consequences, and so we carry out our work respectfully and responsibly.</p>
<p>b. We never misrepresent or exclude information to favor one side. We never side for or against any policy, politician, or organization — except policies that further our mission as described in this charter.</p>
<p>c. We do not accept grants from partisan organizations. Our advertising space is made available to all advertisers without regard to political views.</p>
</ul>

<p>3. We are committed to democracy.</p>

<ul>
<p>a. We believe that transparency and education are crucial for achieving equity in rights and representation for all Americans.</p>
<p>b. We believe that the best outcomes can be achieved not only with an informed public but also with a Congress that has the capacity to make informed decisions.</p>
<p>d. We love the legislative branch (i.e., Congress). That’s why we think about it so much.</p>
