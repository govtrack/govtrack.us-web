# Compute a Markov transition matrix representing the cosponsorship patterns
# of House representatives and (separately) State senators, for a given time period.
# Each transition is from a Member of Congress to another Member of Congress,
# if the former cosponsors a bill of the latter. Columns represent the transition probabilities (i.e. columns sum to 1).
# 
# From the transition matrix, we compute "PageRanks", which are essentially
# implicit leadership scores based on Member cosponsorship behavior, and
# an ideological score based on a singular value decomposition of the matrix
# rank reduction, using the 2nd dimension.
#
# Finally, plot these two dimensions.
#
# To update historical data:
# for c in {93..118}; do echo $c; analysis/sponsorship_analysis.py $c; done
